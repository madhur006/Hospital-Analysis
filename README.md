# Hospital-Analysis
Exploring, Visualizing Hospital Data 
This project was developed as the final project for the **HINF 5531 - Health Data Analytics and Data Science** course at the University of Minnesota.

The data itself is taken from a fictional hospital database. It contains information on patients and their health care encounters, diseases, medications, and providers.
